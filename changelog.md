# LoadingScreenTweaks Changelog
## v1.4.1
- Added "Custom Quotes Only" option, by popular demand. (If no custom quotes are found, the mod will fall back to anything enabled from the default set of quotes.)
- Added Futurama quotes, because why not. (Disabled by default for your sanity.)
- Skip to v1.4.1 for consistency with DeathScreenTweaks.
## v1.3.1
- Fix a crash from selecting Fonts 1 through 9 (even though they're all objectively ugly). Thanks again, hiimjustin000!
## v1.3.0
- Port to 2.206. Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
- Added font setting for splash text.
