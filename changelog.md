# LoadingScreenTweaks Changelog
## v1.4.2
- Port to 2.2074. Shoutout to [B1rtek](https://github.com/b1rtek) and [Fleeym](https://github.com/fleeym) for helping me deal with notoriously clunky SettingsV3 syntax!
## v1.4.1
- Added "Custom Quotes Only" option, by popular demand. (If no custom quotes are found, the mod will fall back to anything enabled from the default set of quotes.)
- Added Futurama quotes, because why not. (Disabled by default for your sanity.)
- Skip to v1.4.1 for consistency with DeathScreenTweaks.
## v1.3.1
- Fix a crash from selecting Fonts 1 through 9 (even though they're all objectively ugly). Thanks again, hiimjustin000!
## v1.3.0
- Port to 2.206. Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
- Added font setting for splash text.
## v1.2.0
- Allow users to customize the text area on the loading screen, much like DisturbingNewBests and WholesomeEndTexts.
## v1.1.0
- Updated to use Node IDs instead of grabbing by index.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release.
